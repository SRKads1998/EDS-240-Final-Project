## Purpose
In this repository, we explore and visualize the various waste streams for disposed material within California. This includes trash, dry recycling, and organics material. Through quantifying and analyzing these waste streams, we may better understand the final destination of what we throw away as Californians. 

## Repository Structure and Contents
Currently, only preliminary data evaluation is included. All data can be readily accessed from CalRecycle's website by following this link:
